## 🧠 Hinglish AI Assistant Fine-Tuning with Gemini Flash 2.0

This project demonstrates how to simulate fine-tuning a Gemini Flash 2.0 model to respond in Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English) using **few-shot learning** and **prompt engineering**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system leverages Google's **Gemini Flash 2.0** model with a few-shot learning approach. Rather than modifying model weights, it guides responses through carefully selected Hinglish examples in a dataset.

---

## 📁 Files in This Project

- **`dataset.jsonl`**: Hinglish input-output examples.
- **`fine_tune.py`**: Prepares the prompt configuration (not actual fine-tuning).
- **`inference.py`**: Tests the model using the prompt config and Hinglish prompts.
- **`gemini_model_config.json`**: Generated prompt configuration for the model.

---

## 🗃️ About `dataset.jsonl`

This file holds Hinglish examples that shape the model’s response style.

### ✅ Format

JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) format — one valid JSON object per line.

### 🔧 Structure

```json
{
  "input_text": "Hinglish query from user",
  "output_text": "Desired Hinglish response"
}
```

### 💬 Example

```jsonl
{"input_text": "Kya haal hai aaj?", "output_text": "Main bilkul theek hoon, aapka din kaisa raha?"}
{"input_text": "Weather kaisa hai aaj Mumbai mein?", "output_text": "Mumbai mein aaj mausam thoda cloudy hai with chances of light rain. Temperature around 28 degrees hai."}
{"input_text": "Mujhe ek acchi book recommend karo", "output_text": "Aapke liye 'The Psychology of Money' by Morgan Housel recommend karunga. Financial wisdom ke baare mein bahut interesting perspectives hai ismein."}
```

### 🛠 Tips for Your Own Dataset

- Each line = valid JSON object  
- Use **diverse, natural Hinglish queries**  
- Mix topics (weather, books, chit-chat, tasks)  
- Maintain **consistent Hinglish style**  

---

## ⚙️ How the System Works

### 1. **Setup API Key**

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 2. **Prepare Dataset**

Populate `dataset.jsonl` with Hinglish input-output examples.

### 3. **Generate Prompt Configuration**

```bash
python fine_tune.py
```

This script:
- Loads `dataset.jsonl`
- Creates `gemini_model_config.json`
- Formats examples for few-shot prompts

### 4. **Run Inference**

```bash
python inference.py
```

This script:
- Loads the prompt config
- Sends multiple queries
- Saves model responses for review

## 🧠 Few-Shot Learning Instead of Fine-Tuning

Instead of updating weights:

1. Hinglish examples are embedded in the prompt  
2. The model uses these to mimic the Hinglish tone  
3. Each user query is matched with 2–3 relevant examples  

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google API key (for Gemini models)
- Install SDK:

```bash
pip install google-genai
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No model weights are changed** – just smart prompt engineering.
- The **quality of responses** depends on your dataset’s diversity and tone.
- Gemini Flash 2.0 has a **large context window**, so it can handle multiple examples.

## ❓ Answers to Whys

### 🤖 Why Gemini Flash 2.0?

- **Fast, cost-efficient, ideal for real-time apps**
- Few-shot prompting supported (not full fine-tuning)
- Better latency than OpenAI’s `davinci` for this use-case

### 🔧 Why No Epochs or Learning Rate?

- Gemini Flash 2.0 doesn't expose those — this is not actual weight-based training.
- “Tuning” is done through:
  - Prompt design
  - Sampling strategies

### ✏️ Prompt Format

```plaintext
You are a helpful assistant that responds in Hinglish...

Examples:
User: <input_text>
Assistant: <output_text>

User: <new query>
Assistant:
```

This teaches the model:
- To adopt Hinglish tone  
- To infer context via few-shot examples  
- To stay natural and polite

### 🎚 Generation Settings

- `temperature = 0.2`: Ensures polite, deterministic replies  
- `top_p = 0.95`, `top_k = 40`: Allows slight variation, avoids hallucinations

---

## ✅ Evaluation Strategy

### 🧑‍⚖️ Human Review

Rate each response by:
- Hinglish authenticity  
- Relevance  
- Fluency & politeness  

### 🤖 Automated Evaluation (Optional)

- **BLEU / ROUGE**: For n-gram similarity (limited use in dialog)  
- **Embedding similarity**: Cosine distance with ground-truth response  
- **Task completion rate**: Did the response meet intent?

### 🗣️ Feedback (For Voice Interfaces)

- Use speech-to-text logs  
- Capture thumbs up/down signals from users

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

This approach balances practicality with performance — using Gemini Flash 2.0’s strengths in prompt engineering to simulate Hinglish fine-tuning without the costs or constraints of model retraining.
